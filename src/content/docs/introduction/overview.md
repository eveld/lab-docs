## Instruqt Lab Platform Overview

Welcome to the Instruqt lab platform documentation. This guide covers everything you need to know about creating, configuring, and managing interactive learning experiences using Instruqt's next-generation HCL-based lab format.

## What is Instruqt?

Instruqt is a platform for creating hands-on, interactive learning experiences. Labs run in real sandbox environments where learners can practice with actual tools, systems, and workflows rather than just reading about them.

## New HCL Lab Format

The new lab format uses HCL to define lab resources in a structured, declarative way. This provides several advantages over the legacy YAML format:

- **Clear Resource Separation**: Labs, sandboxes, tasks, and content are defined as distinct resources
- **Better Organization**: Content files, scripts, and assets are organized in logical directory structures
- **Enhanced Validation**: HCL provides better syntax checking and validation
- **Improved Modularity**: Labs can be composed of reusable modules and configurations

## Documentation Structure

This documentation covers:

- **Introduction**: Getting started and understanding core concepts
- **Lab Configuration**: Defining lab resources, sandboxes, and infrastructure
- **Development Guide**: Creating content, tasks, and interactive elements
- **Migration Tools**: Converting from legacy YAML to new HCL format
- **Configuration Reference**: Complete reference for all lab configuration options
