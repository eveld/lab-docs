# Content Organization

This guide covers how to organize and structure content for your Instruqt labs.

## Chapter and Page Structure

Content is organized hierarchically:

1. **Labs** contain multiple chapters
2. **Chapters** contain multiple pages
3. **Pages** contain instruction content and may include tasks

## Instruction Files

Instruction content is stored as Markdown files in the `instructions/` directory:

<FileTree>
- instructions/
  - introduction/
    - welcome.md First page users see
    - setup.md Environment setup
  - hands-on/
    - first-steps.md Basic tasks
    - advanced.md Complex scenarios
</FileTree>

## Interactive Components

Use Instruqt-specific components to enhance content:

- `<instruqt-task id="task-id">` - Task activities
- `<instruqt-code language="bash">` - Syntax-highlighted code
- `<instruqt-link to="...">` - Styled links
- `<instruqt-button to="...">` - Interactive buttons
