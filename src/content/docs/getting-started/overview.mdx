This guide walks you through creating your first Instruqt lab from scratch. Instruqt labs are interactive learning environments that let learners practice with real tools and technologies in sandboxed environments. Whether you're creating technical training, product demos, or hands-on workshops, this guide covers the essential concepts and steps to get you started.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, verify you have:

- **Git** installed and configured with your name/email ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- **GitHub account** with SSH key setup for pushing code ([Sign up for GitHub](https://github.com/signup))
- **Instruqt CLI** installed and authenticated ([Installation guide](https://docs.instruqt.com/getting-started/installation))
- **Code editor** - VS Code recommended for HCL syntax highlighting ([Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

To verify your prerequisites are properly configured, run:

```bash withOutput
> git --version
git version 2.49.0
```

```bash withOutput
> instruqt version
Version: 2265-8b823dd
```

If you encounter any issues with the prerequisites, check the [Instruqt documentation](https://docs.instruqt.com) or reach out to the Instruqt community for help.
