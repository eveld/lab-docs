**Complete Guide** | **Estimated time: 30 minutes** | **Difficulty: Beginner**

This guide walks you through creating a complete Instruqt lab using the new HCL format. You'll build a functional web server lab with container infrastructure, interactive tasks, and validation scripts.

## What You'll Build

A web server lab that demonstrates core HCL concepts:

- Container infrastructure (nginx web server)
- Resource chaining (network → container → service)
- Interactive task validation
- Content organization with activities

## Prerequisites

Before starting, verify you have:

- **Git** installed and configured with your name/email ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- **GitHub account** with SSH key setup for pushing code ([Sign up for GitHub](https://github.com/signup))
- **Instruqt CLI** installed and authenticated ([Installation guide](https://docs.instruqt.com/getting-started/installation))
- **Code editor** - VS Code recommended for HCL syntax highlighting ([Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

**Quick verification commands:**

```bash withOutput
> git --version
git version 2.39.0
```

```bash withOutput
> instruqt --version
instruqt version 2.4.0
```

If any of these fail, please install the missing tools before continuing.

## Guide Structure

1. **[Project Setup](./project-setup)** - Initialize your lab and GitHub repository
2. **[Infrastructure](./infrastructure)** - Create containers, networks, and services  
3. **[Content & Tasks](./content-tasks)** - Add interactive activities and validation
4. **[Testing & Deployment](./testing-deployment)** - Validate and deploy your lab

Complete steps in order as each builds on the previous one.
