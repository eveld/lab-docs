title: Step 4 - Testing & Deployment
description: Deploy your lab to Instruqt and test the complete learner experience
---

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Your lab is complete and ready for learners! In this final step, you'll deploy your lab to the Instruqt platform and test it as a learner would experience it. This ensures everything works correctly before sharing it with others.

## Final Validation

Before deploying, run one final validation to ensure your complete lab configuration is correct:

```bash
instruqt lab validate
```

This checks for any configuration errors, missing references, or syntax issues that could prevent your lab from working properly on the platform.

## Deploy to Instruqt Platform

Now you'll upload your lab to the Instruqt platform where learners can access it. Use the Instruqt CLI to push your lab:

```bash
instruqt lab push
```

This command:
- Uploads your lab configuration and content to Instruqt
- Validates the lab structure on the platform
- Makes your lab available for testing and sharing

The CLI will show you a URL where you can access your lab once the deployment is complete.

## Test the Learner Experience

After deployment, test your lab exactly as a learner would experience it:

### Start Your Lab

Navigate to the lab URL provided by the CLI or find your lab in the Instruqt platform and click "Start Lab".

### Verify Infrastructure

Check that all your infrastructure components are working:

1. **Terminal access** - Ensure you can run commands in the terminal tab
2. **Web service** - Verify the nginx welcome page loads in the service tab  
3. **File system** - Confirm you can navigate to `/usr/share/nginx/html/` and see the `index.html` file

### Complete the Task

Go through the lab as a learner would:

1. **Read the instructions** - Review the educational content you created
2. **Edit the homepage** - Add "Hello from my web server!" to the nginx homepage
3. **Test the validation** - Ensure the task validates correctly when completed
4. **Check the service tab** - Verify your changes appear in the web browser

### Verify Task Validation

The most critical test is ensuring your validation script works correctly:

- **When incomplete**: The task should show as not completed and provide helpful feedback
- **When completed**: The task should automatically validate and show success
- **Error handling**: If learners make mistakes, they should receive clear guidance

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter problems during testing:

**Lab won't start:**
- Check the validation output for configuration errors
- Ensure all resource references are correct
- Verify your GitHub repository is accessible

**Task validation fails:**
- Test your validation script manually in the terminal
- Check file paths and permissions
- Ensure the script logic matches the task requirements

**Infrastructure issues:**
- Verify container images are pulling correctly
- Check network connectivity between resources
- Confirm service ports are properly exposed

## Share Your Lab

Once testing is complete, your lab is ready to share:

- **Direct link**: Share the lab URL with specific learners
- **Embed in courses**: Add your lab to existing Instruqt tracks or courses
- **Team sharing**: Make the lab available to your organization or team

## What You've Accomplished

Congratulations! You've successfully created and deployed a complete Instruqt lab that includes:

- **Infrastructure as code** with containers, networking, and services
- **Interactive educational content** that teaches real-world skills
- **Automated validation** that provides immediate feedback to learners
- **Professional deployment** on the Instruqt platform ready for use

You now have the foundation to create more complex labs with multiple tasks, advanced infrastructure, and sophisticated learning experiences.

## What's Next

With this foundation, you can:

- **Add more tasks** to create multi-step learning experiences
- **Expand infrastructure** with databases, APIs, or cloud services  
- **Create lab series** that build upon each other
- **Explore advanced features** like dynamic content and branching scenarios

Your journey in creating interactive learning experiences with Instruqt has just begun!
