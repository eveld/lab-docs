title: Step 4 - Testing & Deployment
description: Validate your complete lab and deploy it to the Instruqt platform
---

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Test your complete lab and deploy it to the Instruqt platform.

## Lab Validation

Before running your lab, validate the configuration:

## Complete Lab Validation

Run comprehensive validation on your entire lab:

```bash
instruqt lab validate
```

## Test Your Lab Locally

Start your lab to test the complete experience:

```bash
instruqt lab test my-web-server-lab
```

This command:
- Provisions the infrastructure locally
- Allows you to test all functionality
- Validates that scripts execute correctly in the container context

## Review Your Complete Lab Structure

Your final lab should have this complete structure:

<FileTree>
- my-web-server-lab/
  - main.hcl Lab metadata and configuration
  - layouts.hcl UI layout definitions (from skeleton)
  - sandbox.hcl Network and container infrastructure
  - pages.hcl Content organization with page definitions
  - tasks.hcl Interactive validation tasks
  - tabs.hcl User interface (service and terminal)
  - instructions/
    - customize_homepage.md Step-by-step guide with context
  - scripts/
    - check_homepage.sh Validation logic with helpful feedback
  - assets/ (from skeleton) Media files
  - files/ (from skeleton) Configuration templates
  - notes/ (from skeleton) Note tab content
  - .git/ Version control history
  - README.md Template documentation
</FileTree>

## Final Commit and Documentation

Create a comprehensive final commit:

```bash withOutput
> git add .
```

```bash withOutput
> git commit -m "Complete functional web server lab v1.0"
[main 3f4a567] Complete functional web server lab v1.0
 1 file changed, 15 insertions(+)
```

```bash withOutput
> git push
```

## Deploy to GitHub

Push your lab to GitHub for deployment:

```bash withOutput
> git push origin main
```

## Deploy to Instruqt

Import your lab from GitHub:

1. Log into [instruqt.com](https://instruqt.com)
2. Navigate to Labs → New Lab
3. Select "Import from Git Repository"
4. Enter your GitHub repository URL
5. Click "Import Lab"

The platform will validate and provision your lab infrastructure.

## Test the User Experience

Once deployed:

1. Start your lab from the Instruqt platform
2. Follow your own instructions as a new user would
3. Verify the task validation works correctly
4. Check that all tabs (Terminal, Service) function properly
