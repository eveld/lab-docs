[![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

This is the official documentation site for Instruqt's lab platform, built with Astro Starlight. It provides comprehensive guides for creating, configuring, and managing interactive learning experiences using Instruqt's HCL-based lab format.

## About This Documentation

This documentation covers:

- **Introduction**: Getting started with Instruqt labs and core concepts
- **Lab Configuration**: Defining lab resources, sandbox environments, and infrastructure
- **Development Guide**: Creating content, interactive tasks, and validation scripts
- **Migration Tools**: Converting from legacy YAML tracks to new HCL format
- **API Reference**: Complete reference for all lab configuration options

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ content.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
